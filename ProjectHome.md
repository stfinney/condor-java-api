<a href='http://cs.wisc.edu/condor'>Condor</a> is a scheduling system that has bunch of cool features. The product of this project gives users easy to use Java API to submit, monitor and control Condor jobs from your Java Program.

Although Condor provides Web Services based interface and you can use the interface from Java, we believe that this API is simpler and more straight-forward.
