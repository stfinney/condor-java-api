WHAT IS THIS

  This package meant to help people to write Java programs 
  that submit to and monitor Condor.
  This package provides classes that submit jobs invoking 
  'condor_submit' and monitor log file to find the status
  of jobs.

DIRECTORIES
  This package have following directories.
  - lib        - contains jar files
  - src        - contains source files
  - src/sample - contains sample codes for the API
  - doc        - contains html documentation pages generated 
                 by javadoc

KNOWN DEFECTS
- To make log monitoring easy, this package force to use XML
  log format. This may annoy people since the format is not 
  meant to be read by human being

- Only few kinds of Events are propery handled. If you want
  to handle Globus related events propery, you have to add
  state transition code at the switch statement in
  Job.event().

- Few documentation. Fortunately, the approach is so straight 
  forward and I believe it does not need any documentation
  if you are familiar with Condor.

UPDATE
  Feb. 22, 2005 - released
  Feb. 21, 2008 - repackaged.
                  added some method to 'Job'. 
                  'Cluster' now implements Collection<Job>.
